If you own a Google smart display, chances are it's the first-generation Nest Hub. There have been others: the Lenovo Smart Display powered by Google Assistant or the pricey, camera-equipped Nest Hub Max. At $130 and often on sale, the smaller Nest Hub was the go-to for many smart home consumers.

Yes, Sleep Sensing is the shiny new feature on the second-gen Nest Hub, but that's not the whole story. The new Nest Hub is also 30% cheaper than the original, with 50% more bass, new color options and a more eco-friendly design. Google's new and improved smart display is the best bet for most smart homes.

During setup, a visual guide shows you where to place and aim the display (spoiler: it should be on your nightstand for best results) and asks you to get into your normal sleep position for a few seconds of calibration. After that, you're good to go. A small icon appears on the top right corner of the display when it senses someone in bed, and a larger, banner notification pops up when the display begins tracking sleep.

## Privacy and sleep data

<br />
What does Google gather while you sleep? Since there's no camera, Google obviously isn't recording any facial images or movements. There are microphones, light sensors and temperature sensors involved, but you can adjust what Google records and keeps. Coughing and snoring data (captured by the mic) is only stored locally on your device. You can also choose to disable coughing and snoring detection, but keep sleep tracking on. You can always review and delete your sleep data in the Google Fit app. Google has a helpful page explaining the ins and outs of the Sleep Sensing experience.
